# TO-DO-JS
To Do List App in Vanilla JS


To Do:
// - set up initial.js to draw basic map 
//    a. write it up in html
//    b. style it with css
//    c. move it all to js.
--- ? why did I want to do it all in js? ? ---

- set up a handlers file for dom methods
- set up basic todo functionality

To Do: @ end of 9-24-19
- Started render.js but having trouble pulling todos from other areas need to sort that out.
- still all the basic styling is there and we're drawing most the site from js so that's cool, though perhaps not so best practices
- need to start walking back and forth between the backend logic and the front-end render now.

Initial Drawing:
Only show title on todos
